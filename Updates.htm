20 March 2007 Demo was scheduled for 9:30AM with Garry S. He did not show up.
Show the site to Mike M., Fumi, Janosz P. and Darren L.<br>
21 March 2007 Meeting with Garry S. @ 9:30. Parts manager and Darren came by<br>
22 March 2007 Short meeting with Milan W. this was his last day of work, he is retiring.
Norbert K. is going back to engineering. Some attitude change in Jeff D., He
is planning with Mike M. the outcome of this project&nbsp;<br>
Darren L. named sole supervisor of the electric department&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
Is Mike M. trying to take some credit for this project ????? His comment &quot;I
am working to bring another computer in the electric shop for this project&quot;
I do not remember asking for his help.<br>
23 March 2007 Meeting with Chris (mechanic union rep)<br>
He was impressed with the site. We promised to ask Gerry S about the plan for
development.<br>
@ 3:00PM short meeting in the lab about going there and fixing fare boxes. I am opposed
to the idea same as everybody in the lab<br>
Discus about ET merger. Future plans about sign-up and work flow @ FOH location.<br>
26 March 2007 Meeting with Fumi and James. James mention that he can not help
with the project at this level &quot; Is above what he could imagine&quot; and
he can not contribute. Dan (parts charge hand) was invited to see the site. He
had a very good impression about the idea. He will ask the parts persons to help
with CMBC part numbers.<br>
27 March 2007 Short presentation for the parts department (Sandra, Howard, Dan,
Randy)<br>
28 March 2007 Short conversation with Jeff about the computer. He brings Mike M
in discussion as being part of the project. I am opposed to the any association
to people that for years have done nothing to improve the situation in FOH. He
insists to train James, Mike and others to work on the project this is not going
to happened. Apparently Bruce A. (computers) had a meeting with Mike about the
computer for this project ???????. Today I start writing a letter for Jeff,
Garry and Darren regards this project. My plan is to gain exposure for proper
set-up and funding.&nbsp;<br>
29 March 2007 Short demo to Garry S. He saw the TIL and Pick Lists
implementation . Long discussions with Darren L. about the project. My filing is
that Darren has canceled the installation of the computer because I did not
agree to have the computer installed on James's bench. I may be wrong but I
start to know who is who in this game. Short touch to the &quot;teams&quot;
organized by him, Norbert, James, Mike and Andy. I suggested that each team
should have one member from Monday - Thursday shift and one from Tuesday -
Friday shift this will insure continuity on the jobs taken by any team, better
FOH experience distribution, complete rotation of the personnel. Now we have
Mike and James in one team and Travis with Fumi in another.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
02 April 2007 sent letter to Darren Lefler, Jeff Dow, Gary Strachan. I got back
the emails from Jeff and Gary. I had the wrong address. Resent on 07 April 2007.
Auto reply from Jeff<br>
03 April 2007 Back to work I am assigned for alternators 70 big ones. Andy is
trying to show that he is the boss. SWT tech. is allowed to work over time also
he gets to do more easy work.<br>
04 April 2007 Big change in attitude from Jeff, Darren, (Mike Mello and Andy are
almost violent)<br>
New temporary opening with Translink (ITS administrator up to March 2008)<br>
05 April 2007 Now I know that James is passing the information to Norbert. I
told to Fumi that Norbert is working with James and others on a parallel project
using our information. James continues to play the game of denial, what a
person. Mike Mello is mounting the union against me almost everybody is trying
to harass me. Mike Mello is talking with Glen, Andy, Jag and James about the job
opening as being a trap to take me out of the job in one year.<br>
06 April 2007 I have confronted Jag U. about his attitude and he denies any
planning. I went and talk to Bob Bradford about what is going on. I showed to
him the program I have developed and expressed my concern about an arranged plot
Jeff, Gary, Mike Mello, Andy, Norbert, James, other suspects are: parts
management manager, Darren, Bill Evans, training manager. Fumi is just a victim
he feels insecure and is playing as they ask.<br>
At the parts counter Gerome is trying to give me the same look, he can not mask
very well his intention.<br>
He takes the parts book flipping&nbsp; very slow the pages to look for brass
nuts for DC output. I spent over 15 minutes looking for parts with no success.
The company doesn't stock this item even is specified in Delco manual to use
brass for this connection in order to prevent corrosion of the terminal<br>
I talk to Janosh for a meeting with Jeremy on Tuesday next week. Today is Good
Friday and I am working.<br>
Too bad for a Christian man.<br>
07 April 2007 resent emails to Jeff and Gary. Auto reply from Gary. I am doing
some research on Translink site to see who is in charge of CMBC and TransLink I
may have to contact them. With God's help I came to the conclusion that the job
offer posteb by TransLink is just a trap to take my out of this job.<br>
